        <h2>Conceptual Changes</h2>
        <h3>Thoughts</h3>
        <p>My project still needs tweaking and Thianh helped me further improve it with her suggestions. I first want to make it more interactive so I want to make it so it zooms in to the state itself when hovering over it. Or even maybe try to make a plane go from one state to the next one when it hovers over it. I think the only problem with that is that it might be a bit complicated so I would need help with that. I also want to make it look more pleasing to the eye since it looks flat as of now.</p>
        <h3>Improvisions</h3>
        <p>I feel like my pins itself are really small and hard to see/click on so I want to make it bigger. I also want to crop my world map so people can have the bigger picture since I did not travel to that many states over the world. I feel like cropping down the image will make it easier to see and click on.</p>
