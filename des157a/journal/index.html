        <h2>Overlays Design Pattern Research</h2>
        <p><time datetime="2025-10-22">October 22, 2025</time></p>
        <p> Reading Naema Baskanderi’s <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c" target="_blank"> Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows
        </a> helped me understand both the impact and importance of modal design for user experience. I realized that while modals can simplify interfaces and highlight important content, they can also frustrate users if not handled right. Some key reccomendations from the article included: providing clear close options, descriptive titles, clear button names, being properly sized, and right location. These stood out to me as practical steps to prevent confusion for the users themselves, creating a friendly user experience.</p>
        <p>Something else to note is accessibility being one of the more important factors. Ensuring keyboard navigation, ARIA labeling, and consideration for low-vision users makes a big difference in creating an inclusive experience. On mobile, I’ve noticed that oversized modals can make interaction awkward and hard to use at times. This is a reminder the need to consider device limitations when you are designing overlays.</p>
        <p>As someone interested in UI/UX design, I see how these principles can be applied in my own projects. By being able to follow along with this article and taking notes, I was able to have a better grasp in how I as a designer, can design modals that enhance rather than disrupt user flow. Baskanderi's article reminded me that even small design choices can signifcantly affect the overall satisfaction of the user.</p>
        
        <h2>Reflection on Form Design Best Practices</h2>
        <p><time datetime="2025-10-14">October 14, 2025</time></p>
        <p> In reading Salim Ansari’s <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f" target="_blank"> Best Practices for Form Design
        </a>, I was reminded of how often poorly designed forms can frustrate users and increase abandonment rates. Ansari emphasizes minimizing input fields that don't make the users have to guess the format and being able to include clear instructions near it. By doing so, it will then minimize the users' frustration if what they put did not work. I also found the part about accessibility to stand out since it is our responsibility as designers to allow all users of all abilities to access what we make.</p>
        <p>As someone going into UI/UX graphic design, I appreciate seeing an easy and accessible website. One that I use on a daily basis is <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/signup?forward_url=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2F" target="_blank">Spotify</a> since I feel like they keep their fields quite minimal. This allows quick sign-ups as well as having real-time feedback on passwords, which reduces any errors and improves the usability of it.</p>
        <p>Overall, this article emphasized that form design is not just about aesthetics but about reducing cognitive load and being able to guide users smoothly through the process. I feel like even I would get frustrated if a sign-up process took too long and eventually just give up in the end. By following a few of these best practices, we can easily design something that will significantly improve usability for all.</p>
