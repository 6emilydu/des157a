        <h2>Visual Thinking Strategies Research</h2>
        <p><time datetime="2025-10-27">October 27, 2025</time></p>
        <p> Reading Michael Gonchar’s <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/" target="_blank"> 10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills
        </a> it allowed me to think deeply and observe more when seeing photographs. By being able to slow down rather than skimming an image, a person can truly see the image for what it is and how it can also enhance skills such as reading, writing, and being understanding. </p>
        <p>As someone who is interested in website design, <a href="https://untold.site/en" target="_blank">Untold</a> stood out to me it takes interactivity and imagery to the next level. As you scroll down the website it takes you on a journey and allows viewers to follow this story that unravels as you scroll. I found it super fun and it kept me hooked as I read and looked at the images they provided. To me, it felt like I was exploring a different territory since not many websites demonstrate this level of character and uniqueness.</p>        
        <p>Usually, when I see images that don't catch my attention right away I just go on with my life. I feel like every single photograph tells some kind of story that challenges the viewer to question it and asking "What's going on in this picture?" On the 6th point within the article it says to ask three simple questions being: "What do you notice going on..., What details do you see that make you say that?, and "What more can you find in the text?" By keeping in mind these questions, a person can really dissect a photograph easier.</p>
                
        <h2>Overlays Design Pattern Research</h2>
        <p><time datetime="2025-10-22">October 22, 2025</time></p>
        <p> Reading Naema Baskanderi’s <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c" target="_blank"> Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows
        </a> helped me understand both the impact and importance of modal design for user experience. I realized that while modals can simplify interfaces and highlight important content, they can also frustrate users if not handled right. Some key reccomendations from the article included: providing clear close options, descriptive titles, clear button names, being properly sized, and right location. These stood out to me as practical steps to prevent confusion for the users themselves, creating a friendly user experience.</p>
        <p>Something else to note is accessibility being one of the more important factors. Ensuring keyboard navigation, ARIA labeling, and consideration for low-vision users makes a big difference in creating an inclusive experience. On mobile, I’ve noticed that oversized modals can make interaction awkward and hard to use at times. This is a reminder the need to consider device limitations when you are designing overlays.</p>
        <p>As someone interested in UI/UX design, I see how these principles can be applied in my own projects. By being able to follow along with this article and taking notes, I was able to have a better grasp in how I as a designer, can design modals that enhance rather than disrupt user flow. Baskanderi's article reminded me that even small design choices can signifcantly affect the overall satisfaction of the user.</p>
        
        <h2>Reflection on Form Design Best Practices</h2>
        <p><time datetime="2025-10-14">October 14, 2025</time></p>
        <p> In reading Salim Ansari’s <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f" target="_blank"> Best Practices for Form Design
        </a>, I was reminded of how often poorly designed forms can frustrate users and increase abandonment rates. Ansari emphasizes minimizing input fields that don't make the users have to guess the format and being able to include clear instructions near it. By doing so, it will then minimize the users' frustration if what they put did not work. I also found the part about accessibility to stand out since it is our responsibility as designers to allow all users of all abilities to access what we make.</p>
        <p>As someone going into UI/UX graphic design, I appreciate seeing an easy and accessible website. One that I use on a daily basis is <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/signup?forward_url=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2F" target="_blank">Spotify</a> since I feel like they keep their fields quite minimal. This allows quick sign-ups as well as having real-time feedback on passwords, which reduces any errors and improves the usability of it.</p>
        <p>Overall, this article emphasized that form design is not just about aesthetics but about reducing cognitive load and being able to guide users smoothly through the process. I feel like even I would get frustrated if a sign-up process took too long and eventually just give up in the end. By following a few of these best practices, we can easily design something that will significantly improve usability for all.</p>
